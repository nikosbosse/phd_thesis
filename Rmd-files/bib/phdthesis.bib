  abstract = {Importance This study presents the first set of estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US.Objective To determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US.Design, Setting, and Participants This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months.Exposure(s) COVID-19.Main outcome(s) and measure(s) Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use.Results Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95\% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95\% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95\% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will be a total of 81,114 (95\% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6.Conclusions and Relevance In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.Data availability statement A full list of data citations are available by contacting the corresponding author.Funding Statement Bill \&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the State of WashingtonQuestion Assuming social distancing measures are maintained, what are the forecasted gaps in available health service resources and number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic for each state in the United States?Findings Using a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95\% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95\% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95\% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95\% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months.Meaning Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialN/AFunding StatementFunding was provided by the Bill \&amp; Melinda Gates Found and the State of Washington.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  abstract = {Background Local estimates of the time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in England became increasingly heterogeneous during April and May 2021. This may have been attributable to the spread of the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. This paper documents real-time analysis that aimed to investigate the association between changes in the proportion of positive cases that were S-gene positive, an indicator of the Delta variant against a background of the previously predominant Alpha variant, and the estimated time-varying Rt at the level of upper-tier local authorities (UTLA). Method We explored the relationship between the proportion of samples that were S-gene positive and the Rt of test-positive cases over time from the 23 February 2021 to the 25 May 2021. Effective reproduction numbers were estimated using the EpiNow2 R package independently for each local authority using two different estimates of the generation time. We then fit a range of regression models to estimate a multiplicative relationship between S-gene positivity and weekly mean Rt estimate. Results We found evidence of an association between increased mean Rt estimates and the proportion of S-gene positives across all models evaluated with the magnitude of the effect increasing as model flexibility was decreased. Models that adjusted for either national level or NHS region level time-varying residuals were found to fit the data better, suggesting potential unexplained confounding. Conclusions Our results indicated that even after adjusting for time-varying residuals between NHS regions, S-gene positivity was associated with an increase in the effective reproduction number of COVID-19. These findings were robust across a range of models and generation time assumptions, though the specific effect size was variable depending on the assumptions used. The lower bound of the estimated effect indicated that the reproduction number of Delta was above 1 in almost all local authorities throughout the period of investigation.},

  abstract = {Background: Interventions are now in place worldwide to reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus. Assessing temporal variations in transmission in different countries is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions and the impact of changes in policy. Methods: We use case notification data to generate daily estimates of the time-dependent reproduction number in different regions and countries. Our modelling framework, based on open source tooling, accounts for reporting delays, so that temporal variations in reproduction number estimates can be compared directly with the times at which interventions are implemented. Results: We provide three example uses of our framework. First, we demonstrate how the toolset displays temporal changes in the reproduction number. Second, we show how the framework can be used to reconstruct case counts by date of infection from case counts by date of notification, as well as to estimate the reproduction number. Third, we show how maps can be generated to clearly show if case numbers are likely to decrease or increase in different regions. Results are shown for regions and countries worldwide on our website ( https://epiforecasts.io/covid/ ) and are updated daily. Our tooling is provided as an open-source R package to allow replication by others. Conclusions: This decision-support tool can be used to assess changes in virus transmission in different regions and countries worldwide. This allows policymakers to assess the effectiveness of current interventions, and will be useful for inferring whether or not transmission will increase when interventions are lifted. As well as providing daily updates on our website, we also provide adaptable computing code so that our approach can be used directly by researchers and policymakers on confidential datasets. We hope that our tool will be used to support decisions in countries worldwide throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {Multi-model and multi-team ensemble forecasts have become widely used to generate reliable short-term predictions of infectious disease spread. Notably, various public health agencies have used them to leverage academic disease modelling during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, ensemble forecasts are difficult to interpret and require extensive effort from numerous participating groups as well as a coordination team. In other fields, resource usage has been reduced by training simplified models that reproduce some of the observed behaviour of more complex models. Here we used observations of the behaviour of the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble combined with our own forecasting experience to identify a set of properties present in current ensemble forecasts. We then developed a parsimonious forecast model intending to mirror these properties. We assess forecasts generated from this model in real time over six months (the 15th of January 2022 to the 19th of July 2022) and for multiple European countries. We focused on forecasts of cases one to four weeks ahead and compared them to those by the European forecast hub ensemble. We find that the surrogate model behaves qualitatively similarly to the ensemble in many instances, though with increased uncertainty and poorer performance around periods of peak incidence (as measured by the Weighted Interval Score). The performance differences, however, seem to be partially due to a subset of time points, and the proposed model appears better probabilistically calibrated than the ensemble. We conclude that our simplified forecast model may have captured some of the dynamics of the hub ensemble, but more work is needed to understand the implicit epidemiological model that it represents.},

  abstract = {Background : The current novel coronavirus outbreak appears to have originated from a point-source exposure event at Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event. This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored. \&nbsp; Methods : We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0). We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5\% interval on either side of this estimate. Results : Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate. Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90\% credible interval (CrI)). A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90\% CrI). There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates. There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. Conclusions : Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.},

More than 2,400 participants made forecasts on 261 events over two seasons of a geopolitical prediction tournament. Forecasters were randomly assigned to either prediction markets (continuous double auction markets) in which they were ranked based on earnings, or prediction polls in which they submitted probability judgments, independently or in teams, and were ranked based on Brier scores. In both seasons of the tournament, prices from the prediction market were more accurate than the simple mean of forecasts from prediction polls. However, team prediction polls outperformed prediction markets when forecasts were statistically aggregated using temporal decay, differential weighting based on past performance, and recalibration. The biggest advantage of prediction polls was at the beginning of long-duration questions. Results suggest that prediction polls with proper scoring feedback, collaboration features, and statistical aggregation are an attractive alternative to prediction markets for distilling the wisdom of crowds.This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics.},

Consequently, it is rare for a Bayesian to frequently shift beliefs substantially while remaining relatively uncertain, or, conversely, become very con{\dots}dent with relatively little belief movement. We formalize this intuition by developing speci{\dots}c measures of movement and uncertainty reduction given a Bayesian's changing beliefs over time, showing that these measures are equal in expectation, and creating consequent statistical tests for Bayesianess. We then show connections between these two core concepts and four common psychological biases, suggesting that the test might be particularly good at detecting these biases. We provide support for this conclusion by simulating the performance of our test and other martingale tests. Finally, we apply our test to datasets of individual, algorithmic, and market beliefs.},

  abstract = {Log-linear models are prevalent in empirical research. Yet, how to handle zeros in the dependent variable remains an unsettled issue. This article clarifies it and addresses the log of zero by developing a new family of estimators called iterated Ordinary Least Squares (iOLS). This family nests standard approaches such as log-linear and Poisson regressions, offers several computational advantages, and corresponds to the correct way to perform the popular \${\textbackslash}log(Y+1)\$ transformation. We extend it to the endogenous regressor setting (i2SLS) and overcome other common issues with Poisson models, such as controlling for many fixed-effects. We also develop specification tests to help researchers select between alternative estimators. Finally, our methods are illustrated through numerical simulations and replications of landmark publications.},

  abstract = {The Wasserstein probability metric has received much attention from the machine learning community. Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which strictly measures change in probability, the Wasserstein metric reflects the underlying geometry between outcomes. The value of being sensitive to this geometry has been demonstrated, among others, in ordinal regression and generative modelling. In this paper we describe three natural properties of probability divergences that reflect requirements from machine learning: sum invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients. The Wasserstein metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, does not possess the third. We provide empirical evidence suggesting that this is a serious issue in practice. Leveraging insights from probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric, the Cram{\'e}r distance. We show that the Cram{\'e}r distance possesses all three desired properties, combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler divergences. To illustrate the relevance of the Cram{\'e}r distance in practice we design a new algorithm, the Cram{\'e}r Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and show that it performs significantly better than the related Wasserstein GAN.},

Although many such rules have been developed, relatively little guidance exists as to which rule is the most appropriate. In this paper, we discuss two important properties of quadratic, spherical, and logarithmic scoring rules. From an ex post perspective, we compare their rank order properties and conclude that both quadratic and spherical scoring perform poorly in this regard, relative to logarithmic. Second, from an ex ante perspective, we demonstrate that in many situations, logarithmic scoring is the method least affected by a nonlinear utility function. These results suggest that logarithmic scoring is superior when rank order results are important and/or when the assessor has a nonlinear utility function. In addition to these results, and perhaps more important, we demonstrate that nonlinear utility induces relatively little deviation from the optimal assessment under an assumption of risk neutrality. These results provide both comfort and guidance to those who would like to use scoring rules as part of the assessment process.},

In many cases, the individual terms in these averages are based on observations and forecasts from different distributions. We show that some of the most popular proper scoring rules, such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), give more importance to observations with large uncertainty, which can lead to unintuitive rankings. To describe this issue, we define the concept of local scale invariance for scoring rules. A new class of generalized proper kernel scoring rules is derived and as a member of this class we propose the scaled CRPS (SCRPS). This new proper scoring rule is locally scale invariant and, therefore, works in the case of varying uncertainty. Like the CRPS, it is computationally available for output from ensemble forecasts, and does not require the ability to evaluate densities of forecasts. We further define robustness of scoring rules, show why this also can be an important concept for average scores unless one is specifically interested in extremes, and derive new proper scoring rules that are robust against outliers. The theoretical findings are illustrated in three different applications from spatial statistics, stochastic volatility models and regression for count data.},

This modelling combines knowledge about infectious disease dynamics with the subjective opinion of the researcher who develops and refines the model and often also adjusts model outputs. Developing a forecast model is difficult, resource- and time-consuming. It is therefore worth asking what modelling is able to add beyond the subjective opinion of the researcher alone. To investigate this, we analysed different real-time forecasts of cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland over a 1-4 week horizon submitted to the German and Polish Forecast Hub. We compared crowd forecasts elicited from researchers and volunteers, against a) forecasts from two semi-mechanistic models based on common epidemiological assumptions and b) the ensemble of all other models submitted to the Forecast Hub. We found crowd forecasts, despite being overconfident, to outperform all other methods across all forecast horizons when forecasting cases (weighted interval score relative to the Hub ensemble 2 weeks ahead: 0.89). Forecasts based on computational models performed comparably better when predicting deaths (rel. WIS 1.26), suggesting that epidemiological modelling and human judgement can complement each other in important ways.},

Much theoretical work has been done on the development of proper scoring rules and other scoring metrics that can help evaluate forecasts.

In this paper we introduce scoringutils, an R package that aims to greatly facilitate this process. It is especially geared towards comparing multiple forecasters, regardless of how forecasts were created, and visualising results. The package is able to handle missing forecasts and is the first R package to offer extensive support for forecasts represented through predictive quantiles, a format used by several collaborative ensemble forecasting efforts. The paper gives a short introduction to forecast evaluation, discusses the metrics implemented in scoringutils and gives guidance on when they are appropriate to use, and illustrates the application of the package using example data of forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths submitted to the European Forecast Hub between May and September 2021},

Common scores to evaluate epidemiological forecasts are the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), which can be seen as measures of the absolute distance between the forecast distribution and the observation. However, applying these scores directly to predicted and observed incidence counts may not be the most appropriate due to the exponential nature of epidemic processes and the varying magnitudes of observed values across space and time. In this paper, we argue that transforming counts before applying scores such as the CRPS or WIS can effectively mitigate these difficulties and yield epidemiologically meaningful and easily interpretable results. Using the CRPS on log-transformed values as an example, we list three attractive properties: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a probabilistic version of a relative error. Secondly, it reflects how well models predicted the time-varying epidemic growth rate. And lastly, using arguments on variance-stabilizing transformations, it can be shown that under the assumption of a quadratic mean-variance relationship, the logarithmic transformation leads to expected CRPS values which are independent of the order of magnitude of the predicted quantity. Applying a transformation of log(x + 1) to data and forecasts from the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub, we find that it changes model rankings regardless of stratification by forecast date, location or target types. Situations in which models missed the beginning of upward swings are more strongly emphasised while failing to predict a downturn following a peak is less severely penalised when scoring transformed forecasts as opposed to untransformed ones. We conclude that appropriate transformations, of which the natural logarithm is only one particularly attractive option, should be considered when assessing the performance of different models in the context of infectious disease incidence.},

This project consists in a systematic comparison of such forecasts made for Germany and Poland. The main goals are the following: - create a database of standardized and comparable short-term forecasts. - assess the degree of agreement or disagreement between different forecasts. - systematically and quantitatively evaluate forecasts in order to identify particularly reliable prediction methods. - assess whether combinations of different forecasts (ensemble forecasts) can lead to improved predictive performance. This pre-registration serves to ensure a transparent set of rules and criteria to guide this collaborative study. Many technical and methodological aspects of this project follow the US COVID19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). We aim for compatibility with work from the US in terms of forecast targets, evaluation and various technical aspects.},

  abstract = {For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction.},

  abstract = {Scoring rules are an important tool for evaluating the performance of probabilistic forecasts. A popular example is the Brier score, which allows for a decomposition into terms related to the sharpness (or information content) and to the reliability of the forecast. This feature renders the Brier score a very intuitive measure of forecast quality. In this paper, it is demonstrated that all strictly proper scoring rules allow for a similar decomposition into reliability and sharpness related terms. This finding underpins the importance of proper scores and yields further credence to the practice of measuring forecast quality by proper scores. Furthermore, the effect of averaging multiple probabilistic forecasts on the score is discussed. It is well known that the Brier score of a mixture of several forecasts is never worse that the average score of the individual forecasts. This property hinges on the convexity of the Brier score, a property not universal among proper scores. Arguably, this phenomenon portends epistemological questions which require clarification.},

  abstract = {Scoring rules are an important tool for evaluating the performance of probabilistic forecasting schemes. A scoring rule is called strictly proper if its expectation is optimal if and only if the forecast probability represents the true distribution of the target. In the binary case, strictly proper scoring rules allow for a decomposition into terms related to the resolution and the reliability of a forecast. This fact is particularly well known for the Brier Score. In this article, this result is extended to forecasts for finite-valued targets. Both resolution and reliability are shown to have a positive effect on the score. It is demonstrated that resolution and reliability are directly related to forecast attributes that are desirable on grounds independent of the notion of scores. This finding can be considered an epistemological justification of measuring forecast quality by proper scoring rules. A link is provided to the original work of DeGroot and Fienberg, extending their concepts of sufficiency and refinement.

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable forecasts of seasonal epidemics of infectious disease can assist in the design of countermeasures and increase public awareness and preparedness. This article describes two main contributions we made recently toward this goal: a novel approach to probabilistic modeling of surveillance time series based on ``delta densities'', and an optimization scheme for combining output from multiple forecasting methods into an adaptively weighted ensemble. Delta densities describe the probability distribution of the change between one observation and the next, conditioned on available data; chaining together nonparametric estimates of these distributions yields a model for an entire trajectory. Corresponding distributional forecasts cover more observed events than alternatives that treat the whole season as a unit, and improve upon multiple evaluation metrics when extracting key targets of interest to public health officials. Adaptively weighted ensembles integrate the results of multiple forecasting methods, such as delta density, using weights that can change from situation to situation. We treat selection of optimal weightings across forecasting methods as a separate estimation task, and describe an estimation procedure based on optimizing cross-validation performance. We consider some details of the data generation process, including data revisions and holiday effects, both in the construction of these forecasting methods and when performing retrospective evaluation. The delta density method and an adaptively weighted ensemble of other forecasting methods each improve significantly on the next best ensemble component when applied separately, and achieve even better cross-validated performance when used in conjunction. We submitted real-time forecasts based on these contributions as part of CDC's 2015/2016 FluSight Collaborative Comparison. Among the fourteen submissions that season, this system was ranked by CDC as the most accurate.},

The time at which the growth in the number of infected individuals halts and starts decreasing cannot be calculated with certainty before the turning point is actually attained; neither can the end of the epidemic after the turning point. A susceptible--infected--removed (SIR) model with confinement (SCIR) illustrates how lockdown measures inhibit infection spread only above a threshold that we calculate. The existence of that threshold has major effects in predictability: A Bayesian fit to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain shows that a slowdown in the number of newly infected individuals during the expansion phase allows one to infer neither the precise position of the maximum nor whether the measures taken will bring the propagation to the inhibition regime. There is a short horizon for reliable prediction, followed by a dispersion of the possible trajectories that grows extremely fast. The impossibility to predict in the midterm is not due to wrong or incomplete data, since it persists in error-free, synthetically produced datasets and does not necessarily improve by using larger datasets. Our study warns against precise forecasts of the evolution of epidemics based on mean-field, effective, or phenomenological models and supports that only probabilities of different outcomes can be confidently given.},

  abstract = {The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is one of the most ubiquitous tools in statistical modeling. The first model selection criterion to gain widespread acceptance, AIC was introduced in 1973 by Hirotugu Akaike as an extension to the maximum likelihood principle. Maximum likelihood is conventionally applied to estimate the parameters of a model once the structure and dimension of the model have been formulated. Akaike's seminal idea was to combine into a single procedure the process of estimation with structural and dimensional determination. This article reviews the conceptual and theoretical foundations for AIC, discusses its properties and its predictive interpretation, and provides a synopsis of important practical issues pertinent to its application. Comparisons and delineations are drawn between AIC and its primary competitor, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). In addition, the article covers refinements of AIC for settings where the asymptotic conditions and model specification assumptions that underlie the justification of AIC may be violated.

  abstract = {Consider two forecasters, each making a single prediction for a sequence of events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we compare these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding unverifiable assumptions on how the forecasts and outcomes were generated? In this paper, we present a rigorous answer to this question by designing novel sequential inference procedures for estimating the time-varying difference in forecast scores. To do this, we employ confidence sequences (CS), which are sequences of confidence intervals that can be continuously monitored and are valid at arbitrary data-dependent stopping times ("anytime-valid"). The widths of our CSs are adaptive to the underlying variance of the score differences. Underlying their construction is a game-theoretic statistical framework, in which we further identify e-processes and p-processes for sequentially testing a weak null hypothesis -- whether one forecaster outperforms another on average (rather than always). Our methods do not make distributional assumptions on the forecasts or outcomes; our main theorems apply to any bounded scores, and we later provide alternative methods for unbounded scores. We empirically validate our approaches by comparing real-world baseball and weather forecasters.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a theoretical explanation for the stylized fact that forecast combinations with estimated optimal weights often perform poorly in applications. The properties of the forecast combination are typically derived under the assumption that the weights are fixed, while in practice they need to be estimated. If the fact that the weights are random rather than fixed is taken into account during the optimality derivation, then the forecast combination will be biased (even when the original forecasts are unbiased), and its variance will be larger than in the fixed-weight case. In particular, there is no guarantee that the `optimal' forecast combination will be better than the equal-weight case, or even improve on the original forecasts. We provide the underlying theory, some special cases, and a numerical illustration.},

  abstract = {In a decision and risk analysis, experts may provide subjective probability distributions that encode their beliefs about future uncertain events. For continuous variables, experts often provide these judgments in the form of quantiles of the distribution (e.g., 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles). Psychologists have shown, though, that such subjective distributions tend to be too narrow, representing overconfidence on the part of the expert. We propose an approach for modeling and debiasing expert overconfidence. Based on past performance data (previous assessments and realizations for a number of uncertain variables), and using Bayesian methods to update prior distributions on the model parameters, we show how our model can be used to debias expert probabilities. We develop and demonstrate both a single-expert model and a multiple-expert hierarchical model.},

  abstract = {Background With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare. Methods and findings We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002--2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score [CRPS] = 66.8, 95\% CI 60.6--148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95\% CI 78.5--80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69\%) than that of the baseline model (54.5\%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95\% CI 102--575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95\% CI 120--168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data. Conclusions This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. In 2020, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized hundreds of thousands of specific predictions from more than 50 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. This manuscript systematically evaluates 23 models that regularly submitted forecasts of reported weekly incident COVID-19 mortality counts in the US at the state and national level. One of these models was a multi-model ensemble that combined all available forecasts each week. The performance of individual models showed high variability across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Half of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a na{\"i}ve baseline model. In combining the forecasts from all teams, the ensemble showed the best overall probabilistic accuracy of any model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions farther into the future, with probabilistic accuracy at a 20-week horizon more than 5 times worse than when predicting at a 1-week horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between governmental public health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. Starting in April 2020, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized tens of millions of specific predictions from more than 90 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. A multimodel ensemble forecast that combined predictions from dozens of groups every week provided the most consistently accurate probabilistic forecasts of incident deaths due to COVID-19 at the state and national level from April 2020 through October 2021. The performance of 27 individual models that submitted complete forecasts of COVID-19 deaths consistently throughout this year showed high variability in forecast skill across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Two-thirds of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a na{\"i}ve baseline model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions further into the future, with probabilistic error at a 20-wk horizon three to five times larger than when predicting at a 1-wk horizon.

Using the fact that any differentiable proper scoring rule on a finite sample space \$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}\}\$ is the gradient of a concave homogeneous function, we consider when such a rule can be local in the sense of depending only on the probabilities quoted for points in a nominated neighborhood of \$x\$. Under mild conditions, we characterize such a proper local scoring rule in terms of a collection of homogeneous functions on the cliques of an undirected graph on the space \$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}\}\$. A useful property of such rules is that the quoted distribution \$Q\$ need only be known up to a scale factor.

We also consider the question of interrelationships among forecasters and discuss methods by which an observer should combine the predictions from two or more different forecasters. Then we turn our attention to the concept of a proper scoring rule for evaluating forecasters, relating it to the concepts of calibration and refinement. Finally, we discuss conditions under which one forecaster can exploit the predictions of another forecaster to obtain a better score.},

Using Bayesian modeling and the gender imbalance in COVID-19 data, we attribute 840,000 (95\% CI: [0.39M, 1.26M]) COVID-19 cases across 12 countries to the championship. The impact depends non-linearly on the initial incidence, the reproduction number R, and the number of matches played. The strongest effects are seen in Scotland and England, where as much as 10,000 primary cases per million inhabitants occur from championship-related gatherings. The average match-induced increase in R was 0.46 [0.18, 0.75] on match days, but important matches caused an increase as large as +3. Altogether, our results provide quantitative insights that help judge and mitigate the impact of large-scale events on pandemic spread.},

Although there is some reason to believe that weather forecasters are not identical in all respects to the typical subjects used in judgment and decision-making studies, there also is evidence that weather forecasters are not so different that the existing understanding of human cognition as it relates to making decisions is entirely inapplicable to weather forecasters. Accordingly, some aspects of cognition and decision making are reviewed and considered in terms of how they apply to human weather forecasters, including biases introduced by heuristics. Considerable insight into human forecasting could be gained by applying available studies of the cognitive psychology of decision making. What few studies exist that have used weather forecasters as subjects suggest that further work might well be productive in terms of helping to guide the improvement of weather forecasts by humans. It is concluded that a multidisciplinary approach, involving disciplines outside of meteorology, needs to be developed and supported if there is to be a future role for humans in forecasting the weather.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

We here report the results from prediction markets set up to quantify the reproducibility of 44 studies published in prominent psychology journals and replicated in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. The prediction markets predict the outcomes of the replications well and outperform a survey of market participants' individual forecasts. This shows that prediction markets are a promising tool for assessing the reproducibility of published scientific results. The prediction markets also allow us to estimate probabilities for the hypotheses being true at different testing stages, which provides valuable information regarding the temporal dynamics of scientific discovery. We find that the hypotheses being tested in psychology typically have low prior probabilities of being true (median, 9\%) and that a ``statistically significant'' finding needs to be confirmed in a well-powered replication to have a high probability of being true. We argue that prediction markets could be used to obtain speedy information about reproducibility at low cost and could potentially even be used to determine which studies to replicate to optimally allocate limited resources into replications.},

  abstract = {This textbook presents an introduction to generalized linear models, complete with real-world data sets and practice problems, making it applicable for both beginning and advanced students of applied statistics. Generalized linear models (GLMs) are powerful tools in applied statistics that extend the ideas of multiple linear regression and analysis of variance to include response variables that are not normally distributed. As such, GLMs can model a wide variety of data types including counts, proportions, and binary outcomes or positive quantities.The book is designed with the student in mind, making it suitable for self-study or a structured course. Beginning with an introduction to linear regression, the book also devotes time to advanced topics not typically included in introductory textbooks. It features chapter introductions and summaries, clear examples, and many practice problems, all carefully designed to balance theory and practice. The text also provides a working knowledge of applied statistical practice through the extensive use of R, which is integrated into the text. Other features include: {$\bullet$} Advanced topics such as power variance functions, saddlepoint approximations, likelihood score tests, modified profile likelihood, small-dispersion asymptotics, and randomized quantile residuals {$\bullet$} Nearly 100 data sets in the companion R package GLMsData {$\bullet$} Examples that are cross-referenced to the companion data set, allowing readers to load the data and follow the analysis in their own R session},

  abstract = {An epidemic can be characterized by its strength (i.e., the reproductive number  {$R$} R ) and speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r). Disease modellers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for the classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a dual speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like  {$R$}=1 R=1  [ 1], and show that we can measure the strength and speed of an intervention on the same scale as the strength and speed of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, while the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of `test-and-treat' interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We also discuss evaluating the effects of the importance of pre-symptomatic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

  abstract = {Background Many mathematical models have investigated the impact of expanding access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) on new HIV infections. Comparing results and conclusions across models is challenging because models have addressed slightly different questions and have reported different outcome metrics. This study compares the predictions of several mathematical models simulating the same ART intervention programmes to determine the extent to which models agree about the epidemiological impact of expanded ART. Methods and Findings Twelve independent mathematical models evaluated a set of standardised ART intervention scenarios in South Africa and reported a common set of outputs. Intervention scenarios systematically varied the CD4 count threshold for treatment eligibility, access to treatment, and programme retention. For a scenario in which 80\% of HIV-infected individuals start treatment on average 1 y after their CD4 count drops below 350 cells/{\textmu}l and 85\% remain on treatment after 3 y, the models projected that HIV incidence would be 35\% to 54\% lower 8 y after the introduction of ART, compared to a counterfactual scenario in which there is no ART. More variation existed in the estimated long-term (38 y) reductions in incidence. The impact of optimistic interventions including immediate ART initiation varied widely across models, maintaining substantial uncertainty about the theoretical prospect for elimination of HIV from the population using ART alone over the next four decades. The number of person-years of ART per infection averted over 8 y ranged between 5.8 and 18.7. Considering the actual scale-up of ART in South Africa, seven models estimated that current HIV incidence is 17\% to 32\% lower than it would have been in the absence of ART. Differences between model assumptions about CD4 decline and HIV transmissibility over the course of infection explained only a modest amount of the variation in model results. Conclusions Mathematical models evaluating the impact of ART vary substantially in structure, complexity, and parameter choices, but all suggest that ART, at high levels of access and with high adherence, has the potential to substantially reduce new HIV infections. There was broad agreement regarding the short-term epidemiologic impact of ambitious treatment scale-up, but more variation in longer term projections and in the efficiency with which treatment can reduce new infections. Differences between model predictions could not be explained by differences in model structure or parameterization that were hypothesized to affect intervention impact.

  abstract = {Abstract Quantitative risk assessments facilitate the decisions of risk managers. In the EU, risk assessment in food and feed safety is the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Quantitative risk models should be informed by systematically reviewed scientific evidence, however, in practice empirical evidence is often limited: in such cases it is necessary to turn to expert judgement. Psychological research has shown that unaided expert judgement of the quantities required for risk modelling - and particularly the uncertainty associated with such judgements - is often biased, thus limiting its value. Accordingly methods have been developed for eliciting knowledge from experts in as unbiased a manner as possible. In 2012, a working group was established to develop guidance on expert knowledge elicitation appropriate to EFSA's remit. The resulting Guidance first presents expert knowledge elicitation as a process beginning with defining the risk assessment problem, moving through preparation for elicitation (e.g. selecting the experts and the method to be used) and the elicitation itself, culminating in documentation. Those responsible for managing each of these phases are identified. Next three detailed protocols for expert knowledge elicitation are given - that can be applied to real-life questions in food and feed safety - and the pros and cons of each of these protocols are examined. This is followed by principles for overcoming the major challenges to expert knowledge elicitation: framing the question; selecting the experts; eliciting uncertainty; aggregating the results of multiple experts; and documenting the process. The results of a web search on existing guidance documents on expert elicitation are then reported, along with case studies illustrating some of the protocols of the Guidance. Finally, recommendations are made in the areas of training, organisational changes, expert identification and management, and further developments of expert knowledge elicitation methodology within EFSA.},

  abstract = {Infectious diseases impose considerable burden on society, despite significant advances in technology and medicine over the past century. Advanced warning can be helpful in mitigating and preparing for an impending or ongoing epidemic. Historically, such a capability has lagged for many reasons, including in particular the uncertainty in the current state of the system and in the understanding of the processes that drive epidemic trajectories. Presently we have access to data, models, and computational resources that enable the development of epidemiological forecasting systems. Indeed, several recent challenges hosted by the U.S. government have fostered an open and collaborative environment for the development of these technologies. The primary focus of these challenges has been to develop statistical and computational methods for epidemiological forecasting, but here we consider a serious alternative based on collective human judgment. We created the web-based ``Epicast'' forecasting system which collects and aggregates epidemic predictions made in real-time by human participants, and with these forecasts we ask two questions: how accurate is human judgment, and how do these forecasts compare to their more computational, data-driven alternatives? To address the former, we assess by a variety of metrics how accurately humans are able to predict influenza and chikungunya trajectories. As for the latter, we show that real-time, combined human predictions of the 2014--2015 and 2015--2016 U.S. flu seasons are often more accurate than the same predictions made by several statistical systems, especially for short-term targets. We conclude that there is valuable predictive power in collective human judgment, and we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.},

  abstract = {The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures -- so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) -- aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission. Two fundamental strategies are possible: (a) mitigation, which focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread -- reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection, and (b) suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely. Each policy has major challenges. We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. For countries able to achieve it, this leaves suppression as the preferred policy option. We show that in the UK and US context, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package -- or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission -- will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) -- given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. We show that intermittent social distancing -- triggered by trends in disease surveillance -- may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound. Last, while experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term, and whether the social and economic costs of the interventions adopted thus far can be reduced.},

The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.},

  abstract = {A stationary spatial model is an idealization and we expect that the true dependence structures of physical phenomena are spatially varying, but how should we handle this non-stationarity in practice? We study the challenges involved in applying a flexible non-stationary model to a dataset of annual precipitation in the conterminous US, where exploratory data analysis shows strong evidence of a non-stationary covariance structure. The aim of this paper is to investigate the modelling pipeline once non-stationarity has been detected in spatial data. We show that there is a real danger of over-fitting the model and that careful modelling is necessary in order to properly account for varying second-order structure. In fact, the example shows that sometimes non-stationary Gaussian random fields are not necessary to model non-stationary spatial data.},

  abstract = {Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013--16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: Short-term forecasts of infectious disease can create situational awareness and inform planning for outbreak response. Here, we report on multi-model forecasts of Covid-19 in the UK that were generated at regular intervals starting at the end of March 2020, in order to monitor expected healthcare utilisation and population impacts in real time. Methods: We evaluated the performance of individual model forecasts generated between 24 March and 14 July 2020, using a variety of metrics including the weighted interval score as well as metrics that assess the calibration, sharpness, bias and absolute error of forecasts separately. We further combined the predictions from individual models to ensemble forecasts using a simple mean as well as a quantile regression average that aimed to maximise performance. We further compared model performance to a null model of no change. Results: In most cases, individual models performed better than the null model, and ensembles models were well calibrated and performed comparatively to the best individual models. The quantile regression average did not noticeably outperform the mean ensemble. Conclusions: Ensembles of multi-model forecasts can inform the policy response to the Covid-19 pandemic by assessing future resource needs and expected population impact of morbidity and mortality.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BackgroundEstimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies.AimWe estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19. We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased.MethodsWe used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.ResultsThe mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95\% credible interval (CrI): 3.78-6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95\% CrI: 3.01-4.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48\% (95\% CrI: 32-67) for Singapore and 62\% (95\% CrI: 50-76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.ConclusionHigh estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.},

However, there has only been limited discussion of how predominant forecast evaluation metrics might indicate the success of policies based in part on those forecasts. We explore one possible tether between forecasts and policy: the allocation of limited medical resources so as to minimize unmet need. We use probabilistic forecasts of disease burden in each of several regions to determine optimal resource allocations, and then we score forecasts according to how much unmet need their associated allocations would have allowed. We illustrate with forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US, and we find that the forecast skill ranking given by this allocation scoring rule can vary substantially from the ranking given by the weighted interval score. We see this as evidence that the allocation scoring rule detects forecast value that is missed by traditional accuracy measures and that the general strategy of designing scoring rules that are directly linked to policy performance is a promising direction for epidemic forecast evaluation.},

It is, in effect, the determination of the ``weather related'' statistics of a numerical model. This technique, together with screening regression, has been applied to the prediction of surface wind, probability of precipitation, maximum temperature, cloud amount, and conditional probability of frozen precipitation. Predictors used include surface observations at initial time and predictions from the Subsynoptic Advection Model (SAM) and the Primitive Equation model used operationally by the National Weather Service. Verification scores have been computed, and, where possible, compared to scores for forecasts from other objective techniques and for the official forecasts. MOS forecasts of surface wind, probability of precipitation, and conditional probability of frozen precipitation are being disseminated by the National Weather Service over teletype and facsimile. It is concluded that MOS is a useful technique in objective weather forecasting.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The key idea is that aggregation methods ought to be parsimonious, yet sufficiently flexible to accommodate any type of dispersion in the component distributions. Both linear and non-linear aggregation methods are investigated, including generalized, spread-adjusted and beta-transformed linear pools.

The individual scores are averaged over forecast cases, to result in a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute error or the mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice can lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the forecasting task are carefully matched. Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified ex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a statistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can issue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the scoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is strictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles are elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in peculiar ways. Not all functionals are elicitable; for instance, conditional value-at-risk is not, despite its popularity in quantitative finance.},

We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$} Traditional weather forecasting has been built on a foundation of deterministic modeling--start with initial conditions, put them into a supercomputer model, and end up with a prediction about future weather. But as Gneiting and Raftery discuss in their Perspective, a new approach--ensemble forecasting--was introduced in the early 1990s. In this method, up to 100 different computer runs, each with slightly different starting conditions or model assumptions, are combined into a weather forecast. In concert with statistical techniques, ensembles can provide accurate statements about the uncertainty in daily and seasonal forecasting. The challenge now is to improve the modeling, statistical analysis, and visualization technologies for disseminating the ensemble results. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

To create the scores, we follow earlier approaches and use prediction markets and surveys to forecast replication outcomes. Based on an initial set of forecasts for the overall replication rate in SCORE and its dependence on the academic discipline and the time of publication, we show that participants expect replication rates to increase over time. Moreover, they expect replication rates to differ between fields, with the highest replication rate in economics (average survey response 58\%), and the lowest in psychology and in education (average survey response of 42\% for both fields). These results reveal insights into the academic community's views of the replication crisis, including for research fields for which no large-scale replication studies have been undertaken yet.},

  abstract = {Estimation of the effective reproductive number, Rt, is important for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make methodological recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori et al. (2013), which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis (2004), are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for some retrospective analyses. We advise against using methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. A challenge common to all approaches is reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.},

  abstract = {In situations where forecasters are scored on the quality of their probabilistic predictions, it is standard to use `proper' scoring rules to perform such scoring. These rules are desirable because they give forecasters no incentive to lie about their probabilistic beliefs. However, in the real world context of creating a training program designed to help people improve calibration through prediction practice, there are a variety of desirable traits for scoring rules that go beyond properness. These potentially may have a substantial impact on the user experience, usability of the program, or efficiency of learning. The space of proper scoring rules is too broad, in the sense that most proper scoring rules lack these other desirable properties. On the other hand, the space of proper scoring rules is potentially also too narrow, in the sense that we may sometimes choose to give up properness when it conflicts with other properties that are even more desirable from the point of view of usability and effective training. We introduce a class of scoring rules that we call `Practical' scoring rules, designed to be intuitive to users in the context of `right' vs. `wrong' probabilistic predictions. We also introduce two specific scoring rules for prediction intervals, the `Distance' and `Order of magnitude' rules. These rules are designed to satisfy a variety of properties that, based on user testing, we believe are desirable for applied calibration training.},

  abstract = {Abstract Rank histograms are a tool for evaluating ensemble forecasts. They are useful for determining the reliability of ensemble forecasts and for diagnosing errors in its mean and spread. Rank histograms are generated by repeatedly tallying the rank of the verification (usually an observation) relative to values from an ensemble sorted from lowest to highest. However, an uncritical use of the rank histogram can lead to misinterpretations of the qualities of that ensemble. For example, a flat rank histogram, usually taken as a sign of reliability, can still be generated from unreliable ensembles. Similarly, a U-shaped rank histogram, commonly understood as indicating a lack of variability in the ensemble, can also be a sign of conditional bias. It is also shown that flat rank histograms can be generated for some model variables if the variance of the ensemble is correctly specified, yet if covariances between model grid points are improperly specified, rank histograms for combinations of model variables may not be flat. Further, if imperfect observations are used for verification, the observational errors should be accounted for, otherwise the shape of the rank histogram may mislead the user about the characteristics of the ensemble. If a statistical hypothesis test is to be performed to determine whether the differences from uniformity of rank are statistically significant, then samples used to populate the rank histogram must be located far enough away from each other in time and space to be considered independent.},

From a public health perspective, forecasts of infectious disease spread are of central importance. We argue that such forecasts need to properly incorporate the attached uncertainty, so they should be probabilistic in nature. However, forecasts also need to take into account temporal dependencies inherent to communicable diseases, spatial dynamics through human travel and social contact patterns between age groups. We describe a multivariate time series model for weekly surveillance counts on norovirus gastroenteritis from the 12 city districts of Berlin, in six age groups, from week 2011/27 to week 2015/26. The following year (2015/27 to 2016/26) is used to assess the quality of the predictions. Probabilistic forecasts of the total number of cases can be derived through Monte Carlo simulation, but first and second moments are also available analytically. Final size forecasts as well as multivariate forecasts of the total number of cases by age group, by district and by week are compared across different models of varying complexity. This leads to a more general discussion of issues regarding modelling, prediction and evaluation of public health surveillance data. Copyright {\copyright} 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We distinguish simple from local alternative hypotheses and contrast traditional Bayes factors based on the data with Bayes factors based on p-values or test statistics. A well-known finding is that the minimum Bayes factor, the smallest possible Bayes factor within a certain class of alternative hypotheses, provides less evidence against the null hypothesis than the corresponding p-value might suggest. It is less known that the relationship between p-values and minimum Bayes factors also depends on the sample size and on the dimension of the parameter of interest. We illustrate the transformation of p-values to minimum Bayes factors with two examples from clinical research.},

  abstract = {Abstract Some time ago, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was proposed as a new verification tool for (probabilistic) forecast systems. Its focus is on the entire permissible range of a certain (weather) parameter. The CRPS can be seen as a ranked probability score with an infinite number of classes, each of zero width. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the integral of the Brier score over all possible threshold values for the parameter under consideration. For a deterministic forecast system the CRPS reduces to the mean absolute error. In this paper it is shown that for an ensemble prediction system the CRPS can be decomposed into a reliability part and a resolution/uncertainty part, in a way that is similar to the decomposition of the Brier score. The reliability part of the CRPS is closely connected to the rank histogram of the ensemble, while the resolution/uncertainty part can be related to the average spread within the ensemble and the behavior of its outliers. The usefulness of such a decomposition is illustrated for the ensemble prediction system running at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The evaluation of the CRPS and its decomposition proposed in this paper can be extended to systems issuing continuous probability forecasts, by realizing that these can be interpreted as the limit of ensemble forecasts with an infinite number of members.},

We discuss the prediction patterns and apply signal detection theory to disentangle detection ability from response bias. Our study suggests that laypeople's predictions contain useful information for assessing the probability that a given finding will be replicated successfully.},

In addition to proper scoring rules, functions are provided to assess bias, sharpness and calibration (Sebastian Funk, Anton Camacho, Adam J. Kucharski, Rachel Lowe, Rosalind M. Eggo, W. John Edmunds (2019) {$<$}doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006785{$>$}) of forecasts. Several types of predictions (e.g. binary, discrete, continuous) which may come in different formats (e.g. forecasts represented by predictive samples or by quantiles of the predictive distribution) can be evaluated. Scoring metrics can be used either through a convenient data.frame format, or can be applied as individual functions in a vector / matrix format.

  abstract = {A wide range of research has promised new tools for forecasting infectious disease dynamics, but little of that research is currently being applied in practice, because tools do not address key public health needs, do not produce probabilistic forecasts, have not been evaluated on external data, or do not provide sufficient forecast skill to be useful. We developed an open collaborative forecasting challenge to assess probabilistic forecasts for seasonal epidemics of dengue, a major global public health problem. Sixteen teams used a variety of methods and data to generate forecasts for 3 epidemiological targets (peak incidence, the week of the peak, and total incidence) over 8 dengue seasons in Iquitos, Peru and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Forecast skill was highly variable across teams and targets. While numerous forecasts showed high skill for midseason situational awareness, early season skill was low, and skill was generally lowest for high incidence seasons, those for which forecasts would be most valuable. A comparison of modeling approaches revealed that average forecast skill was lower for models including biologically meaningful data and mechanisms and that both multimodel and multiteam ensemble forecasts consistently outperformed individual model forecasts. Leveraging these insights, data, and the forecasting framework will be critical to improve forecast skill and the application of forecasts in real time for epidemic preparedness and response. Moreover, key components of this project---integration with public health needs, a common forecasting framework, shared and standardized data, and open participation---can help advance infectious disease forecasting beyond dengue.},

There are no universally accepted outcome measures developed for measuring changes in core symptoms. However, the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale) is one of the outcomes recommended in the EMA Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of ASD. Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus on the response definition for CARS among individuals with ASD. The aim of this elicitation process was to determine an appropriate definition of a response on the CARS2 scale for interventions in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). An elicitation process was conducted following the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF). Five experts in the field of ASD and two experts in expert knowledge elicitation participated in an 1-day elicitation workshop. Experts in ASD were previously trained in the SHELF elicitation process and received a dossier of scientific evidence concerning the topic. The response definition was set as the mean clinically relevant improvement averaged over all patients, levels of functioning, age groups and clinicians. Based on the scientific evidence and expert judgment, a normal probability distribution was agreed to represent the state of knowledge of this response with expected value 4.03 and standard deviation 0.664. Considering the remaining uncertainty of the estimation and the available literature, a CARS-2 improvement of 4.5 points has been defined as a threshold to conclude to a response after an intervention. A CARS-2 improvement of 4.5 points could be used to evaluate interventions' meaningfulness in indivudals. This initial finding represents an important new benchmark and may aid decision makers in evaluating the efficacy of interventions in ASD.},

Two studies show how RS can generate accurate forecasts of otherwise unanswerable questions. Study 1 establishes the epistemic credibility of RS: forecasters randomly assigned to use RS were as accurate as forecasters predicting objectively resolvable outcomes using a proper scoring rule---and both groups were more accurate than a control group that felt accountable to neither intersubjective RS metrics nor objective metrics. Study 2 establishes the practical value of RS. We ask highly accurate forecasters to predict each other's forecasts of the effect of government policies on COVID-19 mortality, yielding a real-time ranking of the expected effectiveness of pandemic-containment policies. As in Study 1, RS forecasters converged but in this case on policy recommendations that stand up to scrutiny, even with the benefit of hindsight. The core contribution of RS is its power to create accountability for accuracy in policy debates that have long been stalemated by the absence of accountability.},

  abstract = {Superforecasting has drawn the attention of academics - despite earlier contradictory findings in the literature, arguing that humans can consistently and successfully forecast over long periods. It has also enthused practitioners, due to the major implications for improving forecast-driven decision-making. The evidence in support of the superforecasting hypothesis was provided via a 4-year project led by Tetlock and Mellers, which was based on an exhaustive experiment with more than 5000 experts across the globe, resulting in identifying 260 superforecasters. The result, however, jeopardizes the applicability of the proposition, as exciting as it may be for the academic world; if every company in the world needs to rely on the aforementioned 260 experts, then this will end up an impractical and expensive endeavor. Thus, it would make sense to test the superforecasting hypothesis in real-life conditions: when only a small pool of experts is available, and there is limited time to identify the superforecasters. If under these constrained conditions the hypothesis still holds, then many small and medium-sized organizations could identify fast and consequently utilize their own superforecasters. In this study, we provide supportive empirical evidence from an experiment with an initial (small) pool of 314 experts and an identification phase of (just) 9 months. Furthermore - and corroborating to the superforecasting literature, we also find preliminary evidence that even an additional training of just 20~min, can influence positively the number of superforecasters identified.},

We further our understanding of LLMs and their causal implications, considering the distinctions between different types of causal reasoning tasks, as well as the entangled threats of construct and measurement validity. LLM-based methods establish new state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple causal benchmarks. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97\%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92\%, 20 points gain), and actual causality (86\% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). At the same time, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes and we provide some techniques to interpret their robustness. Crucially, LLMs perform these causal tasks while relying on sources of knowledge and methods distinct from and complementary to non-LLM based approaches. Specifically, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. We envision LLMs to be used alongside existing causal methods, as a proxy for human domain knowledge and to reduce human effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. We also see existing causal methods as promising tools for LLMs to formalize, validate, and communicate their reasoning especially in high-stakes scenarios. In capturing common sense and domain knowledge about causal mechanisms and supporting translation between natural language and formal methods, LLMs open new frontiers for advancing the research, practice, and adoption of causality.},

  abstract = {Forecasting the weather is an increasingly data-intensive exercise. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are becoming more complex, with higher resolutions, and there are increasing numbers of different models in operation. While the forecasting skill of NWP models continues to improve, the number and complexity of these models poses a new challenge for the operational meteorologist: how should the information from all available models, each with their own unique biases and limitations, be combined in order to provide stakeholders with well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts to use in decision making? In this paper, we use a road surface temperature example to demonstrate a three-stage framework that uses machine learning to bridge the gap between sets of separate forecasts from NWP models and the `ideal' forecast for decision support: probabilities of future weather outcomes. First, we use quantile regression forests to learn the error profile of each numerical model, and use these to apply empirically derived probability distributions to forecasts. Second, we combine these probabilistic forecasts using quantile averaging. Third, we interpolate between the aggregate quantiles in order to generate a full predictive distribution, which we demonstrate has properties suitable for decision support. Our results suggest that this approach provides an effective and operationally viable framework for the cohesive post-processing of weather forecasts across multiple models and lead times to produce a well-calibrated probabilistic output., This article is part of the theme issue `Machine learning for weather and climate modelling'.},

Eighteen operational chemical weather forecasting models on regional and continental scales in Europe are described and compared in this article. Topics discussed in this article include how weather forecasting and atmospheric chemistry models are integrated into chemical weather forecasting systems, how physical processes are incorporated into the models through parameterization schemes, how the model architecture affects the predicted variables, and how air chemistry and aerosol processes are formulated. In addition, we discuss sensitivity analysis and evaluation of the models, user operational requirements, such as model availability and documentation, and output availability and dissemination. In this manner, this article allows for the evaluation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various modelling systems and modelling approaches. Finally, this article highlights the most prominent gaps of knowledge for chemical weather forecasting models and suggests potential priorities for future research directions, for the following selected focus areas: emission inventories, the integration of numerical weather prediction and atmospheric chemical transport models, boundary conditions and nesting of models, data assimilation of the various chemical species, improved understanding and parameterization of physical processes, better evaluation of models against data and the construction of model ensembles.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Ensemble forecasts are the method of choice in numerical weather prediction (NWP) to generate probabilistic forecasts. The number of members in an ensemble is an important factor in determining how well a probability distribution of a weather-related variable can be estimated. Having only a finite number of members reduces the average skill such a probabilistic forecast can have. Increasing ensemble size is therefore desirable; however, ensemble size is also proportional to the computational cost. Having a small ensemble size limits the cost and makes other improvements, such as increases in spatial resolution, feasible. This article examines how average skill measures with metrics such as the continuous ranked probability score, the quantile score, and the Dawid--Sebastiani score converge with ensemble size. A numerical experiment with a 200 member ensemble using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model at a resolution of 29 km and a forecast range of 15 days provides data to compare the convergence of probabilistic skill in a current NWP system with theoretical expectations derived for perfectly reliable ensembles with exchangeable members. Results in the first part of the article can help users of operational NWP ensemble forecasts formulate their minimum requirement in terms of ensemble size. In the second part, requirements for scientists who test changes to NWP systems are examined. Using proper scores and fair scores, it is explored whether testing changes in the ensemble forecasts can be meaningful with fewer members than in the operational configuration. Results are based on medium-range numerical experiments with 50 members. Two experiments test the activation of a representation of model uncertainty and three other experiments test changes in horizontal resolution from 29 to 18 km and from 29 to 45 km.},

  abstract = {Improving ensemble forecasts is a complex process which involves proper scores such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). A homogeneous Gaussian (hoG) model is introduced in order to better understand the characteristics of the CRPS. An analytical formula is derived for the expected CRPS of an ensemble in the hoG model. The score is a function of the variance of the error of the ensemble mean, the mean error of the ensemble mean and the ensemble variance. The hoG model also provides a score decomposition into reliability and resolution components. We examine whether the hoG model provides a useful approximation of the CRPS when applied to operational ECMWF medium-range ensemble forecasts. The hoG approximation describes the spatial variations of the CRPS well while moderately overestimating the mean score. Seasonal averages over large domains are within 10\% of the actual CRPS. Furthermore, the ability to approximate score changes is evaluated by (a) comparing raw ensemble forecasts with postprocessed ensemble forecasts, and (b) by examining score changes associated with a recent upgrade of the IFS. Overall, the hoG approximation predicts the actual CRPS changes well. One of the main anticipated applications of the hoG approximation are new diagnostics in verification software used by NWP developers routinely. The purpose of the diagnostics is to help developers explain impacts of forecast system changes on the CRPS in terms of the changes in mean error, changes in error variance and changes in ensemble variance. The diagnostics require little additional computational resources compared to the alternative of verifying postprocessed versions of the ensemble forecasts. Therefore, it will be feasible to apply the diagnostics easily to all variables that are examined as part of the model development process.},

An important special case of this class is the so-called INGARCH model and its log-linear extension. The package includes methods for model fitting and assessment, prediction and intervention analysis. This paper summarizes the theoretical background of these methods. It gives details on the implementation of the package and provides simulation results for models which have not been studied theoretically before.

Owing to a possible risk of increasing the transmissibility of the virus, severity of the infected individuals, and the ability to escape the antibody produced by the vaccines, the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) have attracted the most widespread attention. At present, there is a unified conclusion that these four variants have increased the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, but the severity of the disease caused by them has not yet been determined. Studies from June 1, 2020 to October 15, 2021 were considered, and a meta-analysis was carried out to process the data. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants are all more serious than the wild-type virus in terms of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality, and the Beta and Delta variants have a higher risk than the Alpha and Gamma variants. Notably, the random effects of Beta variant to the wild-type virus with respect to hospitalization rate, severe illness rate, and mortality rate are 2.16 (95\% CI: 1.19--3.14), 2.23 (95\% CI: 1.31--3.15), and 1.50 (95\% CI: 1.26--1.74), respectively, and the random effects of Delta variant to the wild-type virus are 2.08 (95\% CI: 1.77--2.39), 3.35 (95\% CI: 2.5--4.2), and 2.33 (95\% CI: 1.45--3.21), respectively. Although, the emergence of vaccines may reduce the threat posed by SARS-CoV-2 variants, these are still very important, especially the Beta and Delta variants.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic runoff forecasts generated by stochastic greybox models can be notably useful for the improvement of the decision-making process in real-time control setups for urban drainage systems because the prediction risk relationships in these systems are often highly nonlinear. To date, research has primarily focused on one-step-ahead flow predictions for identifying, estimating, and evaluating greybox models. For control purposes, however, stochastic predictions are required for longer forecast horizons and for the prediction of runoff volumes, rather than flows. This article therefore analyzes the quality of multistep ahead forecasts of runoff volume and considers new estimation methods based on scoring rules for k-step-ahead predictions. The study shows that the score-based methods are, in principle, suitable for the estimation of model parameters and can therefore help the identification of models for cases with noisy in-sewer observations. For the prediction of the overflow risk, no improvement was demonstrated through the application of stochastic forecasts instead of point predictions, although this result is thought to be caused by the notably simplified setup used in this analysis. In conclusion, further research must focus on the development of model structures that allow the proper separation of dry and wet weather uncertainties and simulate runoff uncertainties depending on the rainfall input.},

Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis \$f = g\$ the probability of obtaining a given \$U\$ in a sample of \$n x's\$ and \$m y's\$ is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving \$n\$ and \$m\$. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of \$U\$ for samples up to \$n = m = 8\$. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if \$m, n\$ go to infinity in any arbitrary manner.

However, the parameter being tested can also be expressed in terms of moments of the predictors and the predicted variable, some of which cannot be identified separately by the observations on the prediction errors alone. Parameterizing these moments in a GMM framework and drawing on the theory of West (1996), we devise more powerful versions of the test by exploiting a restriction that is maintained routinely under the null hypothesis by West (1996, Assumption 2b) and later studies. This restriction requires only finite second-order moments and covariance stationarity in order to ensure that the population linear projection exists. Simulation experiments show that the potential gains in power can be substantial.},

But in the middle of 2020, vaccine effectiveness, safety, and the timeline for when a vaccine would be approved and distributed to the public was uncertain. To support public health decision making, we solicited trained forecasters and experts in vaccinology and infectious disease to provide monthly probabilistic predictions from July to September of 2020 of the efficacy, safety, timing, and delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine. We found, that despite sparse historical data, a linear pool---a combination of human judgment probabilistic predictions---can quantify the uncertainty in clinical significance and timing of a potential vaccine. The linear pool underestimated how fast a therapy would show a survival benefit and the high efficacy of approved COVID-19 vaccines. However, the linear pool did make an accurate prediction for when a vaccine would be approved by the FDA. Compared to individual forecasters, the linear pool was consistently above the median of the most accurate forecasts. A linear pool is a fast and versatile method to build probabilistic predictions of a developing vaccine that is robust to poor individual predictions. Though experts and trained forecasters did underestimate the speed of development and the high efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, linear pool predictions can improve situational awareness for public health officials and for the public make clearer the risks, rewards, and timing of a vaccine.},

Statistical models can produce accurate forecasts given abundant training data, but when data is sparse or rapidly changing, statistical models may not be able to make accurate predictions. Expert judgmental forecasts---models that combine expert-generated predictions into a single forecast---can make predictions when training data is limited by relying on human intuition. Researchers have proposed a wide array of algorithms to combine expert predictions into a single forecast, but there is no consensus on an optimal aggregation model.

We propose a chimeric ensemble-a combination of computational and human judgment forecasts-as a novel approach to predicting the trajectory of an infectious agent. Each month from January, 2021 to June, 2021 we asked two generalist crowds, using the same criteria as the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, to submit a predictive distribution over incident cases and deaths at the US national level either two or three weeks into the future and combined these human judgment forecasts with forecasts from computational models submitted to the COVID-19 Forecasthub into a chimeric ensemble. We find a chimeric ensemble compared to an ensemble including only computational models improves predictions of incident cases and shows similar performance for predictions of incident deaths. A chimeric ensemble is a flexible, supportive public health tool and shows promising results for predictions of the spread of an infectious agent.},

Forecast skill was highest for seasonal peak intensity and short-term forecasts, while forecast skill for timing of season onset and peak week was generally low. Higher forecast skill was associated with team participation in previous influenza forecasting challenges and utilization of ensemble forecasting techniques.

This study evaluated probabilistic post-processing approaches, including the nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR), affine kernel dressing (AKD), and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) techniques, for improving daily and weekly ET\textsubscript{0} forecasting based on single or multiple numerical weather predictions (NWPs) from the THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE), which includes the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS), and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) forecasts. The approaches were examined for the forecasting of summer ET\textsubscript{0} at 101 US Regional Climate Reference Network stations distributed all over the contiguous United States (CONUS). We found that the NGR, AKD, and BMA methods greatly improved the skill and reliability of the ET\textsubscript{0} forecasts compared with a linear regression bias correction method, due to the considerable adjustments in the spread of ensemble forecasts. The methods were especially effective when applied over the raw NCEP forecasts, followed by the raw UKMO forecasts, because of their low skill compared with that of the raw ECMWF forecasts. The post-processed weekly forecasts had much lower rRMSE values (between 8\&thinsp;\% and 11\&thinsp;\%) than the persistence-based weekly forecasts (22\&thinsp;\%) and the post-processed daily forecasts (between 13\&thinsp;\% and 20\&thinsp;\%). Compared with the single-model ensemble, ET\textsubscript{0} forecasts based on ECMWF multi-model ensemble ET\textsubscript{0} forecasts showed higher skill at shorter lead times (1 or 2\&thinsp;d) and over the southern and western regions of the US. The improvement was higher at a daily timescale than at a weekly timescale. The NGR and AKD methods showed the best performance; however, unlike the AKD method, the NGR method can post-process multi-model forecasts and is easier to interpret than the other methods. In summary, this study demonstrated that the three probabilistic approaches generally outperform conventional procedures based on the simple bias correction of single-model forecasts, with the NGR post-processing of the ECMWF and ECMWF--UKMO forecasts providing the most cost-effective ET\textsubscript{0} forecasting.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The SS and the CSS are both standardized versions of the Brier, or probability, score (PS) and have been used to measure the "skill" of probability forecasts. The SS is defined in terms of individual forecasts, while the CSS is defined in terms of collections of forecasts. The SS and the CSS are shown to be improper scoring rules, and, as a result, both the SS and the CSS encourage hedging on the part of forecasters. The results of a preliminary investigation of the nature of the hedging produced by the SS and the CSS indicate that, while the SS may encourage a considerable amount of hedging, the CSS, in general, encourages only a modest amount of hedging, and even this hedging decreases as the sample size K of the collection forecasts increases. In fact, the CSS is approximately strictly proper for large collections of forecasts (K{$\geq$}100). Finally, we briefly consider two questions related to the standardization of scoring rules: 1) the use of different scoring rules in the assessment and evaluation tasks, and 2) the transformation of strictly proper scoring rules. With regard to the latter, we identify standardized versions of the PS which are strictly proper scoring rules and which, as a result, appear to be appropriate scoring rules to use to measure the "skill" of probability forecasts.},

  abstract = {An estimate of the mean effect of ensemble-averaging on forecast skill, under idealized `perfect model' conditions, is obtained from a set of eight independent 50-day winter ensemble forecast experiments made with a hemispheric version of the Meteorological Office (UKMO) 5-level general circulation model. Each ensemble forecast consisted of seven individual integrations. Initial conditions for these were obtained by adding spatially correlated perturbations to a given wintertime analysis, and a further integration created in the same manner was used to represent nature, giving the perfect model approach. The ensemble-mean forecast shows a clear improvement in amplitude and phase skill compared with individual forecasts, the period of significant predictability for daily fields being increased by 50\%. The improvement in skill is consistent with simple theoretical estimates based on the perfect model assumption. These calculations are used to deduce how ensemble-mean forecast skill should vary with the size of ensemble. The superiority of the ensemble-mean is maintained when forecasts are spatially smoothed or time-averaged. The spread of an ensemble distribution can in principle give an a priori indication of forecast skill. A moderate level of correlation between ensemble spread and the forecast skill of the ensemble-mean is found on the hemispheric scale. The extent to which the potential benefits of ensemble forecasting may be achieved in reality depends on the model's practical forecast skill. Since the practical skill of the 5-level model is rather low, an ensemble-mean forecast is on average no better than an individual forecast up to the normal limit of deterministic predictability. However, in four experiments where the individual forecasts show skill beyond this point, the ensemble-mean forecast does give increased skill. Spatial variations in both the practical and perfect model skills of an ensemble-mean anomaly field are found to be related to corresponding variations in the statistical significance of the anomaly field. For example, the average perfect model skill, in regions where the ensemble-mean anomaly is significantly different from zero, exceeds the full field skill in all experiments for forecast days 1--15, and in all but two cases for days 16--30.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}When new pathogens emerge, numerous questions arise about their future spread, some of which can be addressed with probabilistic forecasts. The many uncertainties about the epidemiology of emerging pathogens can make it difficult to choose among model structures and assumptions, however. To assess the potential for uncertainties about emerging pathogens to affect forecasts of their spread, we evaluated the performance of a suite of 16 forecasting models in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia. Each model featured a different combination of assumptions about the role of human mobility in driving transmission, spatiotemporal variation in transmission potential, and the number of times the virus was introduced. All models used the same core transmission model and the same iterative data assimilation algorithm to generate forecasts. By assessing forecast performance through time using logarithmic scoring with ensemble weighting, we found that which model assumptions had the most ensemble weight changed through time. In particular, spatially coupled models had higher ensemble weights in the early and late phases of the epidemic, whereas non-spatial models had higher ensemble weights at the peak of the epidemic. We compared forecast performance of the equally-weighted ensemble model to each individual model and identified a trade-off whereby certain individual models outperformed the ensemble model early in the epidemic but the ensemble model outperformed all individual models on average. On balance, our results suggest that suites of models that span uncertainty across alternative assumptions are necessary to obtain robust forecasts in the context of emerging infectious diseases.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This study aims to elicit opinion and gain consensus on appropriate medicine use for people living with dementia in Australia to create a consensus-based list of explicit prescribing criteria. Methods and analysis: A Delphi technique will be used to develop explicit criteria of medication use in adults aged 65 years and above. An interdisciplinary panel of Australian experts in geriatric therapeutics will be convened that will consist of a minimum of 10 participants. To develop the consensus-based criteria, this study will use an iterative, anonymous, multistaged approach with controlled feedback. Round 1 questionnaire will be administered, and subsequently qualitatively analysed. The round 1 results will be fed back to the panel members, and a round 2 questionnaire developed using questions on a five-point Likert scale. This process will repeat until consensus is developed, or diminishing returns are noted. Ethics and dissemination: All participants will be provided with a participant information sheet, and sign a written consent form. Ethical approval has been granted from the University of Western Australia's Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (reference: RA/4/1/7172). We expect that data from this study will result in a paper published in a peerreviewed clinical journal and will also present the results at conferences.},

The instantaneous reproduction number, Rt, is predominant among these statistics, measuring the average ability of an infection to multiply. However, Rt encodes no temporal information and is sensitive to modelling assumptions. Consequently, some have proposed the epidemic growth rate, rt, i.e., the rate of change of the log-transformed case incidence, as a more temporally meaningful and model-agnostic policy guide. We examine this assertion, identifying if and when estimates of rt are more informative than those of Rt. We assess their relative strengths both for learning about pathogen transmission mechanisms and for guiding epidemic interventions in real time.},

  abstract = {Early assessments of the growth rate of COVID-19 were subject to significant uncertainty, as expected with limited data and difficulties in case ascertainment, but as cases were recorded in multiple countries, more robust inferences could be made. Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we estimated that, when unconstrained, European COVID-19 confirmed cases doubled on average every 3 days (range 2.2--4.3 days) and Italian hospital and intensive care unit admissions every 2--3 days; values that are significantly lower than the 5--7 days dominating the early published literature. Furthermore, we showed that the impact of physical distancing interventions was typically not seen until at least 9 days after implementation, during which time confirmed cases could grow eightfold. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the time-insensitive basic reproduction number R0 for initiating interventions, and that the combination of fast growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries' outbreak response better than large values of R0 alone. One year on from first reporting these results, reproduction numbers continue to dominate the media and public discourse, but robust estimates of unconstrained growth remain essential for planning worst-case scenarios, and detection delays are still key in informing the relaxation and re-implementation of interventions.

These variants, Wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron were characterized by variations in transmissibility and severity. We used a robust mathematical model and Bayesian inference framework to analyse epidemiological surveillance data from England. We quantified the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), therapeutics, and vaccination on virus transmission and severity. Each successive variant had a higher intrinsic transmissibility. Omicron (BA.1) had the highest basic reproduction number at 8.4 (95\% credible interval (CrI) 7.8-9.1). Varying levels of NPIs were crucial in controlling virus transmission until population immunity accumulated. Immune escape properties of Omicron decreased effective levels of immunity in the population by a third. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies, we found Alpha had the highest basic infection fatality ratio (3.0\%, 95\% CrI 2.8-3.2), followed by Delta (2.1\%, 95\% CrI 1.9--2.4), Wildtype (1.2\%, 95\% CrI 1.1--1.2), and Omicron (0.7\%, 95\% CrI 0.6-0.8). Our findings highlight the importance of continued surveillance. Long-term strategies for monitoring and maintaining effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 are critical to inform the role of NPIs to effectively manage future variants with potentially higher intrinsic transmissibility and severe outcomes.},

Much has been written about the ``wisdom of the crowds'' and how collective opinions will outperform individual ones. We present the concept of the ``wisdom of the data'' and how data manipulation can result in information extraction which, in turn, translates to improved forecast accuracy by aggregating (combining) forecasts computed on different perspectives of the same data. We describe and discuss approaches that are based on the manipulation of local curvatures (theta method), temporal aggregation, bootstrapping, sub-seasonal and incomplete time series. We compare these approaches with regards to how they extract information from the data, their computational cost, and their performance.},

This followed the promise that, supplied with information about uncertainty, people would take better risk-based decisions. In recent years, therefore, research and operational developments have also started focusing attention on ways of communicating the probabilistic forecasts to decision-makers. Communicating probabilistic forecasts includes preparing tools and products for visualisation, but also requires understanding how decision-makers perceive and use uncertainty information in real time. At the EGU General Assembly 2012, we conducted a laboratory-style experiment in which several cases of flood forecasts and a choice of actions to take were presented as part of a game to participants, who acted as decision-makers. Answers were collected and analysed. In this paper, we present the results of this exercise and discuss if we indeed make better decisions on the basis of probabilistic forecasts.},

We conducted a survey in April 2020 of 140 UK experts and 2,086 UK laypersons; all were asked to make four quantitative predictions about the impact of COVID-19 by 31 Dec 2020. In addition to soliciting point estimates, we asked participants for lower and higher bounds of a range that they felt had a 75\% chance of containing the true answer. Experts exhibited greater accuracy and calibration than laypersons, even when restricting the comparison to a subset of laypersons who scored in the top quartile on a numeracy test. Even so, experts substantially underestimated the ultimate extent of the pandemic, and the mean number of predictions for which the expert intervals contained the actual outcome was only 1.8 (out of 4), suggesting that experts should consider broadening the range of scenarios they consider plausible. Predictions of the public were even more inaccurate and poorly calibrated, suggesting that an important role remains for expert predictions as long as experts acknowledge their uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013/2014 season. In the 2017/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.},

  abstract = {Influenza infects an estimated 9--35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.},

However, the direct implementation entails a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

Energy distance is zero if and only if the distributions are identical, thus it characterizes equality of distributions and provides a theoretical foundation for statistical inference and analysis. Energy statistics are functions of distances between observations in metric spaces. As a statistic, energy distance can be applied to measure the difference between a sample and a hypothesized distribution or the difference between two or more samples in arbitrary, not necessarily equal dimensions. The name energy is inspired by the close analogy with Newton's gravitational potential energy. Applications include testing independence by distance covariance, goodness-of-fit, nonparametric tests for equality of distributions and extension of analysis of variance, generalizations of clustering algorithms, change point analysis, feature selection, and more.

In this paper we propose a new method that is fully adaptive to heteroscedasticity. It combines conformal prediction with classical quantile regression, inheriting the advantages of both. We establish a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage, supplemented by extensive experiments on popular regression datasets. We compare the efficiency of conformalized quantile regression to other conformal methods, showing that our method tends to produce shorter intervals.},

The Probability integral transformation (PIT) can be used to convert the question of whether a given sample originates from a reference distribution into a problem of testing for uniformity. We present new simulation and optimization based methods to obtain simultaneous confidence bands for the whole empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the PIT values under the assumption of uniformity. Simultaneous confidence bands correspond to such confidence intervals at each point that jointly satisfy a desired coverage. These methods can also be applied in cases where the reference distribution is represented only by a finite sample. The confidence bands provide an intuitive ECDF-based graphical test for uniformity, which also provides useful information on the quality of the discrepancy. We further extend the simulation and optimization methods to determine simultaneous confidence bands for testing whether multiple samples come from the same underlying distribution. This multiple sample comparison test is especially useful in Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics. We provide numerical experiments to assess the properties of the tests using both simulated and real world data and give recommendations on their practical application in computational statistics workflows.},

As such, accurate accounting of both meteorological and hydrologic uncertainties is critical to producing reliable probabilistic hydrologic prediction. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a statistical procedure that accounts for hydrologic uncertainty in short-range (1 to 5 days ahead) ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP). Referred to as the ESP post-processor, the procedure operates on ensemble traces of model-predicted streamflow that reflect only the meteorological uncertainty and produces post-processed ensemble traces that reflect both the meteorological and hydrologic uncertainties. A combination of probability matching and regression, the procedure is simple, parsimonious and robust. For a critical evaluation of the procedure, independent validation is carried out for five basins of the Juniata River in Pennsylvania, USA, under a very stringent setting. The results indicate that the post-processor is fully capable of producing ensemble traces that are unbiased in the mean and in the probabilistic sense. Due primarily to the uncertainties in the cumulative probability distributions (CDF) of observed and simulated flows, however, the unbiasedness may be compromised to a varying degree in real world situations. It is also shown, however, that the uncertainties in the CDF's do not significantly diminish the value of post-processed ensemble traces for decision making, and that probabilistic prediction based on post-processed ensemble traces significantly improves the value of single-value prediction at all ranges of flow.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The availability of real-time, web-based estimates of local influenza infection rates makes this type of quantitative forecasting possible. Retrospective ensemble forecasts are generated on a weekly basis following assimilation of these web-based estimates for the 2003--2008 influenza seasons in New York City. The findings indicate that real-time skillful predictions of peak timing can be made more than 7 wk in advance of the actual peak. In addition, confidence in those predictions can be inferred from the spread of the forecast ensemble.

  abstract = {The time-varying reproduction number (Rt: the average number secondary infections caused by each infected person) may be used to assess changes in transmission potential during an epidemic. While new infections are not usually observed directly, they can be estimated from data. However, data may be delayed and potentially biased. We investigated the sensitivity of Rt estimates to different data sources representing Covid-19 in England, and we explored how this sensitivity could track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups. We sourced public data on test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with confirmed Covid-19 in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved infections to each data source. We then compared differences in Rt with the demographic and social context of surveillance data over time. Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source, with the relative inconsistency of estimates varying across regions and over time. Rt estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than when compared to estimates from all test-positives. We found these differences may be linked to biased representations of subpopulations in each data source. These included spatially clustered testing, and where outbreaks in hospitals, care homes, and young age groups reflected the link between age and severity of disease. We highlight that policy makers could better target interventions by considering the source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify the best way to combine and interpret Rt estimates from different data sources based on the desired use.},

  abstract = {Background  Short-term forecasts of infectious disease burden can contribute to  situational awareness and aid capacity planning. Based on best practice in  other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can  maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are  combined into an ensemble. Here we report on the performance of ensembles in  predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe between 08 March 2021 and  07 March 2022. Methods  We used open-source tools to develop a public European COVID-19 Forecast  Hub. We invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for COVID-19  cases and deaths reported from a standardised source over the next one to  four weeks. Teams submitted forecasts from March 2021 using standardised  quantiles of the predictive distribution. Each week we created an ensemble  forecast, where each predictive quantile was calculated as the  equally-weighted average (initially the mean and then from 26th July the  median) of all individual models' predictive quantiles. We measured the  performance of each model using the relative Weighted Interval Score (WIS),  comparing models' forecast accuracy relative to all other models. We  retrospectively explored alternative methods for ensemble forecasts,  including weighted averages based on models' past predictive  performance. Results  Over 52 weeks we collected and combined up to 28 forecast models for 32  countries. We found a weekly ensemble had a consistently strong performance  across countries over time. Across all horizons and locations, the ensemble  performed better on relative WIS than 84\% of participating models' forecasts  of incident cases (with a total N=862), and 92\% of participating models'  forecasts of deaths (N=746). Across a one to four week time horizon,  ensemble performance declined with longer forecast periods when forecasting  cases, but remained stable over four weeks for incident death forecasts. In  every forecast across 32 countries, the ensemble outperformed most  contributing models when forecasting either cases or deaths, frequently  outperforming all of its individual component models. Among several choices  of ensemble methods we found that the most influential and best choice was  to use a median average of models instead of using the mean, regardless of  methods of weighting component forecast models. Conclusions  Our results support the use of combining forecasts from individual  models into an ensemble in order to improve predictive performance across  epidemiological targets and populations during infectious disease epidemics.  Our findings further suggest that median ensemble methods yield better  predictive performance more than ones based on means. Our findings also  highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death  forecasts than incident case forecasts at forecast horizons greater than two  weeks.

  abstract = {Infectious disease forecasting for ongoing epidemics has been traditionally performed, communicated, and evaluated as numerical targets - 1, 2, 3, and 4 week ahead cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. While there is great value in predicting these numerical targets to assess the burden of the disease, we argue that there is also value in communicating the future trend (description of the shape) of the epidemic -- for instance, if the cases will remain flat or a surge is expected. To ensure what is being communicated is useful we need to be able to evaluate how well the predicted shape matches with the ground truth shape. Instead of treating this as a classification problem (one out of \$n\$ shapes), we define a transformation of the numerical forecasts into a ``shapelet''-space representation. In this representation, each dimension corresponds to the similarity of the shape with one of the shapes of interest (a shapelet). We prove that this representation satisfies the property that two shapes that one would consider similar are mapped close to each other, and vice versa. We demonstrate that our representation is able to reasonably capture the trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths time-series. With this representation, we define an evaluation measure and a measure of agreement among multiple models. We also define the shapelet-space ensemble of multiple models as the mean of their shapelet-space representations. We show that this ensemble is able to accurately predict the shape of the future trend for COVID-19 cases and trends. We also show that the agreement between models can provide a good indicator of the reliability of the forecast.},

The book is intended primarily for students enrolled for a masters degree in epidemiology, clinical epidemiology, or biostatistics, and should be suitable both as the basis for a taught course and for private study. No previous knowledge is assumed, and the mathematical level has been chosen to suit readers whose basic training is in biology. The most important concept in statistics is the probability model. All statistical analysis of data is based on probability models, even though these may not be explicit. Only by fully understanding the model can one fully understand the analysis. In showing how to use models in epidemiology the authors have chosen to emphasize the role of likelihood. This is an approach to statistics which is both simple and intuitively satisfying, and has the additional advantage that it requires the model and its parameters to be made explicit, even in the simplest situations.},

This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on quantile regression forests (QRF), a generalization of random forests for quantile regression. This method does not fit a parametric probability density function (PDF) like in ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) but provides an estimation of desired quantiles. This is a nonparametric approach that eliminates any assumption on the variable subject to calibration.

QRF provides sharp and reliable probabilistic forecasts. At last, classical scoring rules to verify predictive forecasts are completed by the introduction of entropy as a general measure of reliability.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has placed forecasting models at the forefront of health policy making. Predictions of mortality and hospitalization help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we aggregate the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. With only limited information available regarding the historical accuracy of the forecasting teams, we consider aggregation (i.e. combining) methods that do not rely on a record of past accuracy. In this empirical paper, we evaluate the accuracy of aggregation methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods, which enable robust estimation and allow the aggregate forecast to reduce the impact of a tendency for the forecasting teams to be under- or overconfident. We use data that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. While the simple average performed well for the high mortality series, we obtained greater accuracy using the median and certain trimming methods for the low and medium mortality series. It will be interesting to see if this remains the case as the pandemic evolves.},

We show that the associated test for bias is inappropriate before introducing a more suitable procedure which is based on the test for bias in a conditional mean forecast. Although volatility has been the most common measure of the variability in a financial time series, in many situations confidence interval forecasts are required. We consider the evaluation of interval forecasts and present a regression-based procedure which uses quantile regression to assess quantile estimator bias and variance. We use exchange rate data to illustrate the proposal by evaluating seven quantile estimators, one of which is a new non-parametric autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity quantile estimator.

  abstract = {Forecasting tournaments are level-playing-field competitions that reveal which individuals, teams, or algorithms generate more accurate probability estimates on which topics. This article describes a massive geopolitical tournament that tested clashing views on the feasibility of improving judgmental accuracy and on the best methods of doing so. The tournament's winner, the Good Judgment Project, outperformed the simple average of the crowd by (a) designing new forms of cognitive-debiasing training, (b) incentivizing rigorous thinking in teams and prediction markets, (c) skimming top talent into elite collaborative teams of ``super forecasters,'' and (d) fine-tuning aggregation algorithms for distilling greater wisdom from crowds. Tournaments have the potential to open closed minds and increase assertion-to-evidence ratios in polarized scientific and policy debates.},

  abstract = {Ensemble forecasting resorts to multiple individual forecasts to produce a discrete probability distribution which accurately represents the uncertainties. Before every forecast, a weighted empirical distribution function is derived from the ensemble, so as to minimize the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). We apply online learning techniques, which have previously been used for deterministic forecasting, and we adapt them for the minimization of the CRPS. The proposed method theoretically guarantees that the aggregated forecast competes, in terms of CRPS, against the best weighted empirical distribution function with weights constant in time. This is illustrated on synthetic data. Besides, our study improves the knowledge of the CRPS expectation for model mixtures. We generalize results on the bias of the CRPS computed with ensemble forecasts, and propose a new scheme to achieve fair CRPS minimization, without any assumption on the distributions.},

Our weighted extension of conformal prediction also applies more broadly, to settings in which the data satisfies a certain weighted notion of exchangeability. We discuss other potential applications of our new conformal methodology, including latent variable and missing data problems.},

The challenge is to retain validity, while improving efficiency. In this article a very generic method is proposed which takes advantage of a well-established result in Classical Statistical Hypothesis Testing, the NeymanPearson Lemma, to combine CP with maximum efficiency. The merits and the limits of the method are explored on synthetic data sets under different levels of correlation between NonConformity Measures (NCM). CP Combination via Neyman-Pearson Lemma generally outperforms other combination methods when an accurate and robust density ratio estimation method, such as the V-Matrix method, is used.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Brier score (BS) and its generalizations to the multicategory ranked probability score (RPS) and to the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) are the prominent verification measures for probabilistic forecasts. Particularly, their decompositions into measures quantifying the reliability, resolution, and uncertainty of the forecasts are attractive. Information theory sets up the natural framework for forecast verification. Recently, it has been shown that the BS is a second-order approximation of the information-based ignorance score (IGN), which also contains easily interpretable components and can also be generalized to a ranked version (RIGN). Here, the IGN, its generalizations, and decompositions are systematically discussed in analogy to the variants of the BS. Additionally, a continuous ranked IGN (CRIGN) is introduced in analogy to the CRPS. The applicability and usefulness of the conceptually appealing CRIGN are illustrated, together with an algorithm to evaluate its components reliability, resolution, and uncertainty for ensemble-generated forecasts.},

The final aim is to provide optimal, automated, seamless forecasts for end users. Many techniques are now flourishing in the statistical, meteorological, climatological, hydrological, and engineering communities. The methods range in complexity from simple bias corrections to very sophisticated distribution-adjusting techniques that incorporate correlations among the prognostic variables. The paper is an attempt to summarize the main activities going on in this area from theoretical developments to operational applications, with a focus on the current challenges and potential avenues in the field. Among these challenges is the shift in NMS toward running ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems at the kilometer scale that produce very large datasets and require high-density high-quality observations, the necessity to preserve space--time correlation of high-dimensional corrected fields, the need to reduce the impact of model changes affecting the parameters of the corrections, the necessity for techniques to merge different types of forecasts and ensembles with different behaviors, and finally the ability to transfer research on statistical postprocessing to operations. Potential new avenues are also discussed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The regression schemes under consideration include the ordinary leastsquare (OLS) method, a new time-dependent Tikhonov regularization (TDTR) method, the total least-square method, a new geometric-mean regression (GM), a recently introduced error-in-variables (EVMOS) method and, finally, a ``best member'' OLS method.

Human judgment systems can complement computational models by providing valuable real-time forecasts. We report findings from a study conducted on Metaculus, a community forecasting platform, in partnership with the Virginia Department of Health, involving six rounds of forecasting during the Omicron BA.1 wave in the United States from November 2021 to March 2022. We received 8355 probabilistic predictions from 129 unique users across 60 questions pertaining to cases, hospitalizations, vaccine uptake, and peak/trough activity. We observed that the case forecasts performed on par with national multi-model ensembles and the vaccine uptake forecasts were more robust and accurate compared to baseline models. We also identified qualitative shifts in Omicron BA.1 wave prognosis during the surge phase, demonstrating rapid adaptation of such systems.

Human judgment systems can complement computational models by providing valuable real-time forecasts. We report findings from a study conducted on Metaculus, a community forecasting platform, in partnership with the Virginia Department of Health, involving six rounds of forecasting during the Omicron BA.1 wave in the United States from November 2021 to March 2022. We received 8355 probabilistic predictions from 129 unique users across 60 questions pertaining to cases, hospitalizations, vaccine uptake, and peak/trough activity. We observed that the case forecasts performed on par with national multi-model ensembles and the vaccine uptake forecasts were more robust and accurate compared to baseline models. We also identified qualitative shifts in Omicron BA.1 wave prognosis during the surge phase, demonstrating rapid adaptation of such systems. Finally, we found that community estimates of variant characteristics such as growth rate and timing of dominance were in line with the scientific consensus. The observed accuracy, timeliness, and scope of such systems demonstrates the value of incorporating them into pandemic policymaking workflows.},

  abstract = {Infectious disease forecasting is gaining traction in the public health community; however, limited systematic comparisons of model performance exist. Here we present the results of a synthetic forecasting challenge inspired by the West African Ebola crisis in 2014--2015 and involving 16 international academic teams and US government agencies, and compare the predictive performance of 8 independent modeling approaches. Challenge participants were invited to predict 140 epidemiological targets across 5 different time points of 4 synthetic Ebola outbreaks, each involving different levels of interventions and ``fog of war'' in outbreak data made available for predictions. Prediction targets included 1--4 week-ahead case incidences, outbreak size, peak timing, and several natural history parameters. With respect to weekly case incidence targets, ensemble predictions based on a Bayesian average of the 8 participating models outperformed any individual model and did substantially better than a null auto-regressive model. There was no relationship between model complexity and prediction accuracy; however, the top performing models for short-term weekly incidence were reactive models with few parameters, fitted to a short and recent part of the outbreak. Individual model outputs and ensemble predictions improved with data accuracy and availability; by the second time point, just before the peak of the epidemic, estimates of final size were within 20\% of the target. The 4th challenge scenario - mirroring an uncontrolled Ebola outbreak with substantial data reporting noise - was poorly predicted by all modeling teams. Overall, this synthetic forecasting challenge provided a deep understanding of model performance under controlled data and epidemiological conditions. We recommend such ``peace time'' forecasting challenges as key elements to improve coordination and inspire collaboration between modeling groups ahead of the next pandemic threat, and to assess model forecasting accuracy for a variety of known and hypothetical pathogens.},

Violation of this assumption would render the scale misinterpreted or cause systematic bias against certain groups of persons. While a number of methods have been proposed to detect measurement invariance violations, they typically require advance definition of problematic item parameters and respondent grouping information. However, these pieces of information are typically unknown in practice. As an alternative, this paper focuses on a family of recently proposed tests based on stochastic processes of casewise derivatives of the likelihood function (i.e., scores). These score-based tests only require estimation of the null model (when measurement invariance is assumed to hold), and they have been previously applied in factor-analytic, continuous data contexts as well as in models of the Rasch family. In this paper, we aim to extend these tests to two-parameter item response models, with strong emphasis on pairwise maximum likelihood. The tests' theoretical background and implementation are detailed, and the tests' abilities to identify problematic item parameters are studied via simulation. An empirical example illustrating the tests' use in practice is also provided.},

Influenza forecasting is used to inform seasonal outbreak response, which can in turn potentially reduce the societal impact of an epidemic. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with external researchers, has run an annual prospective influenza forecasting exercise, known as the FluSight challenge. A subset of participating teams has worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble, the FluSight Network ensemble. Uniting theoretical results from the forecasting literature with domain-specific forecasts from influenza outbreaks, we applied parametric forecast combination methods that simultaneously optimize individual model weights and calibrate the ensemble via a beta transformation. We used the beta-transformed linear pool and the finite beta mixture model to produce ensemble forecasts retrospectively for the 2016/2017 to 2018/2019 influenza seasons in the U.S. We compared their performance to methods currently used in the FluSight challenge, namely the equally weighted linear pool and the linear pool. Ensemble forecasts produced from methods with a beta transformation were shown to outperform those from the equally weighted linear pool and the linear pool for all week-ahead targets across in the test seasons based on average log scores. We observed improvements in overall accuracy despite the beta-transformed linear pool or beta mixture methods' modest under-prediction across all targets and seasons. Combination techniques that explicitly adjust for known calibration issues in linear pooling should be considered to improve ensemble probabilistic scores in outbreak settings.},

The score is a reinterpretation of the logarithmic score or ignorance score, now formulated as the relative entropy or Kullback--Leibler divergence of the forecast distribution from the observation distribution. Using the information--theoretical concepts of entropy and relative entropy, a decomposition into three components is presented, analogous to the classic decomposition of the Brier score. The information--theoretical twins of the components uncertainty, resolution, and reliability provide diagnostic information about the quality of forecasts. The overall score measures the information conveyed by the forecast. As was shown recently, information theory provides a sound framework for forecast verification. The new decomposition, which has proven to be very useful for the Brier score and is widely used, can help acceptance of the logarithmic score in meteorology.},

One avenue for correcting the resulting forecast reliability errors is to calibrate the streamflow forecast ensemble to match observed error characteristics. This paper outlines and evaluates a method for forecast calibration as applied to seasonal streamflow prediction. The approach uses the correlation of forecast ensemble means with observations to generate a conditional forecast mean and spread that lie between the climatological mean and spread (when the forecast has no skill) and the raw forecast mean with zero spread (when the forecast is perfect). Retrospective forecasts of summer period runoff in the Feather River basin, California, are used to demonstrate that the approach improves upon the performance of traditional ESP forecasts by reducing errors in forecast mean and improving spread estimates, thereby increasing forecast reliability and skill.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

By providing a summary encompassing these domains, this survey connects them, establishing a common ground for future discussions. To this end, we survey literature on human judgement and quantitative forecasting as well as hybrid methods that involve both humans and algorithmic approaches. The survey starts with key search terms that identified more than 280 publications in the fields of computer science, operations research, risk analysis, decision science, psychology and forecasting. Results show an almost 10-fold increase in the application-focused forecasting literature between the 1990s and the current decade, with a clear rise of quantitative, data-driven forecasting models. Comparative studies of quantitative methods and human judgement show that (1) neither method is universally superior, and (2) the better method varies as a function of factors such as availability, quality, extent and format of data, suggesting that (3) the two approaches can complement each other to yield more accurate and resilient models. We also identify four research thrusts in the human/machine-forecasting literature: (i) the choice of the appropriate quantitative model, (ii) the nature of the interaction between quantitative models and human judgement, (iii) the training and incentivization of human forecasters, and (iv) the combination of multiple forecasts (both algorithmic and human) into one. This review surveys current research in all four areas and argues that future research in the field of human/machine forecasting needs to consider all of them when investigating predictive performance. We also address some of the ethical dilemmas that might arise due to the combination of quantitative models with human judgement.},

Postprocessing is often a necessary step before GCM forecasts can be applied in practice. Quantile mapping (QM) is rapidly becoming the method of choice by operational agencies to postprocess raw GCM outputs. The authors investigate whether QM is appropriate for this task. Ensemble forecast postprocessing methods should aim to 1) correct bias, 2) ensure forecasts are reliable in ensemble spread, and 3) guarantee forecasts are at least as skillful as climatology, a property called ``coherence.'' This study evaluates the effectiveness of QM in achieving these aims by applying it to precipitation forecasts from the POAMA model. It is shown that while QM is highly effective in correcting bias, it cannot ensure reliability in forecast ensemble spread or guarantee coherence. This is because QM ignores the correlation between raw ensemble forecasts and observations. When raw forecasts are not significantly positively correlated with observations, QM tends to produce negatively skillful forecasts. Even when there is significant positive correlation, QM cannot ensure reliability and coherence for postprocessed forecasts. Therefore, QM is not a fully satisfactory method for postprocessing forecasts where the issues of bias, reliability, and coherence pre-exist. Alternative postprocessing methods based on ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) are available that achieve not only unbiased but also reliable and coherent forecasts. This is shown with one such alternative, the Bayesian joint probability modeling approach.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {This study proposes a modified Diebold--Mariano (DM) test for equal forecast accuracy with clustered dependence. A novel consistent long-run variance estimator is developed to account for the clustered dependence. The modified DM test statistic asymptotically follows a normal distribution. The moving block bootstrap is employed to improve the size and power performance of the newly proposed test. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that the modified DM test has a better finite sample performance than the conventional DM test.},

  abstract = {Scenario reduction techniques are widely applied for solving sophisticated dynamic and stochastic programs, especially in energy and power systems, but are also used in probabilistic forecasting, clustering and estimating generative adversarial networks. We propose a new method for ensemble and scenario reduction based on the energy distance which is a special case of the maximum mean discrepancy. We discuss the choice of energy distance in detail, especially in comparison to the popular Wasserstein distance which is dominating the scenario reduction literature. The energy distance is a metric between probability measures that allows for powerful tests for equality of arbitrary multivariate distributions or independence. Thanks to the latter, it is a suitable candidate for ensemble and scenario reduction problems. The theoretical properties and considered examples indicate clearly that the reduced scenario sets tend to exhibit better statistical properties for the energy distance than a corresponding reduction with respect to the Wasserstein distance. We show applications to a Bernoulli random walk and two real data-based examples for electricity demand profiles and day-ahead electricity prices. This article is part of the theme issue `The mathematics of energy systems'.},

  abstract = {Forecasting future world events is a challenging but valuable task. Forecasts of climate, geopolitical conflict, pandemics and economic indicators help shape policy and decision making. In these domains, the judgment of expert humans contributes to the best forecasts. Given advances in language modeling, can these forecasts be automated? To this end, we introduce Autocast, a dataset containing thousands of forecasting questions and an accompanying news corpus. Questions are taken from forecasting tournaments, ensuring high quality, real-world importance, and diversity. The news corpus is organized by date, allowing us to precisely simulate the conditions under which humans made past forecasts (avoiding leakage from the future). Motivated by the difficulty of forecasting numbers across orders of magnitude (e.g. global cases of COVID-19 in 2022), we also curate IntervalQA, a dataset of numerical questions and metrics for calibration. We test language models on our forecasting task and find that performance is far below a human expert baseline. However, performance improves with increased model size and incorporation of relevant information from the news corpus. In sum, Autocast poses a novel challenge for large language models and improved performance could bring large practical benefits.},
