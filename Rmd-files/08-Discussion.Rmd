- Issue with human forecasting: 
  - trust in public health decision making
  
  
  
  

## Future work

- combining humans and models
  - Rt forecasting
  - using humans to predict parameters
    - Metaculus question we authored
    - Monkeypox work that Tom made - things are complicated
  - Heaving humans come up with model weights

- Related: Develop ways to scale human forecasting

- Unclear what score corresponds to what usefulness: e.g. if we show decision makers different forecasts, which score will choose the model that different decision makers describe as the most useful one. 
- Also lots of potential development for new and composite scores. 

- Modelling of scores - e.g. by standardising the scores. 

- how do details of human forecasters
