Forecasting, in its most general sense, is simply a statement about the future.

- Different between forecast and scenario

Applications of epidemiological models differ in the way they make statements about the future. Forecasts aim to predict the future as it will occur, while scenario modelling and projections aim to represent what the future could look like under certain scenario assumptions or if conditions stayed the same as they were in the past. Forecasts can be judged by comparing them against observed data. Since it is much harder to fairly assess the accuracy and usefulness of projections and scenario modelling in the same way, this work focuses on forecasts, which represent only a subset of all epidemiological modelling.


## Forecast evaluation
- Why forecast evaluation: useful for 

- History of forecast evaluation 
  - started with the log score, then Brier score, etc... 
  - proper scoring rule
  - possible decomposition
  
- more detailed info in Chapter \@{scoringutils}

- Problems in forecast evaluation
  - application is tedious in R. From a user perspective it's not clear which score to use
  - different scores have different properties and it's unclear which one corresponds to what you want. Solutions to that in Chapters \@(scoringutils) and \@(LogTransform). 
  - we only have a mathematical score, unclear which score corresponds to what usefulness

## Human Judgement forecasting

- Literature review

- Things that have been tried in the past, with what success

- Comparisons between forecasts and models

- Open things: 
  - direct 1:1 comparison
  - analysis of what human judgment adds to a computer model
  - no open source tools to 

- Crowdforecastr tool
  - R shiny
  - probabilistic forecasting

## Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases

- uses computers
- necessarily some combination of human judgement and algorithmic assumptions
- varying degrees of human intervention. 

### Mechanistic models

- mechanistic assumptions about disease progress
- learning about paramters 
- SIR models

### Statistical models

- uses statistical features, without making any assumptions about the disease progress

### Semi-mechanistic models

Mixture of the two
